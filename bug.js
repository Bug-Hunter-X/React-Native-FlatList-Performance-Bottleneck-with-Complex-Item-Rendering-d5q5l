In React Native, a less common error arises when using the `FlatList` component with a large dataset and complex item rendering.  The problem manifests as slow rendering, dropped frames, and ultimately, poor user experience.  The root cause often lies in inefficient rendering logic within the item component, which may be performing expensive operations or recalculating values unnecessarily on every render. This can lead to dropped frames even if the actual number of items is within the FlatList's capacity. This can lead to the error message "Maximum update depth exceeded" if a component is updating itself during render. 

Example Item Component (Inefficient):
```javascript
function MyItem({ item }) {
  const complexCalculation = calculateSomethingComplex(item); // Expensive operation
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{complexCalculation}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
```
